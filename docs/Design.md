## 1. Introduction
The Room Booking Application is a system that let users to book university classrooms and laboratories. This application is thought for teachers who need a classroom for seminaries or lectures and for the students who need workstations in the laboratories.

## 5. Software architecture

The application is standalone, mono-process and single-thread. The application is multi-layer. A data access layer carries out the comunication with the database layer and all the operations related to the data management: insert, read, update and delete. A user interaction layer carries out the interaction with the user and the comunication with the data access layer below.
