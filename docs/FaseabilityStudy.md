## 1. Introduction
This application can be a useful tool for teachers and students belonging to University. As shown in the use case diagram of the [Design Document](./Design.md) for each user action the system must perform a reading operation. Furthermore, these operations could be expensive, for example views on a relational database. Each time that a teacher wants to book a classroom in a specific schedule, the system must retreive in the database the informations about the available classrooms, their capacity and the building in which they are located. All these informations must be shown together to the teacher in order to let him choose the classroom that respects his needs. 
For this reason we want to explore the possibility to improve the system performances exploiting different databases tecnologies.

## 2. Problem
A possible data model for the application exploiting a relational database solution could involve a table for each entity of the application domain, such as: teacher, classroom, building and classroom booking in which information about the booking of each teacher are stored. In this scenario to show to the teacher useful informations about the available rooms, a view, joining classroom and building table in the database is needed. Furthermore, also the write operations are expensive. For example, in the classroom table we store information about its availability as a boolean attribute in the table. Every time that a teacher books a classroom the availability must be checked and updated if needed to mantain the consistency of the information. Also the operation of checking the availability of the classroom involves a join between multiple tables, in this case: teacher, classroom booking and classroom. Likewise, this occurs also in the case of students that want to see or book a laboratory. The amount of performed operations could affect the performance of the system.

## 3. Possible solutions

    WITH WHAT
        key value databases
            haloDB (constraints on key and leveldb)
            levelDb
## 4. LevelDB
    WHY LEVELDB
        simple
        fast 
        low memory
        no constraints on key and values
        easy to implement

## 5. Solution
    Solution
        updated views stored in leveldb    
        to show views
